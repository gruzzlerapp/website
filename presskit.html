							<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
							<p>
								Gruzzler is a sudoku variant with a discovery element similar to popular word-guessing games. In this unique number puzzle game, you start with a blank grid and get clues by entering numbers and receiving feedback. If you put in a 5, an arrow will point to the closest 5 in the grid or column. If they're equidistant, you get two arrows. If the cell IS a 5, you get a ⌘ indicating a 'spot on' clue.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								What makes Gruzzler special is its focus on deduction through exploration, rather than following a predetermined path set by the puzzle creator. You discover your own path through the puzzle, creating a unique solving experience every time.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Gruzzler scales to any skill level because you get 81 clues on a 9x9 grid. It typically takes about 30 for a good player on a good day, meaning that even on your worst days, you can solve a Gruzzler. It can be a brain burner or just a wind-down activity, depending on your approach and mood.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Perhaps most excitingly, the sets of clues you discover can be shared with others. Everyone gets to be a 'setter' with Gruzzler, creating a community of puzzle creators and solvers.

							<h2 id="history">History</h2>
							<p>
								The idea for Gruzzler began in 2021 when our developer discovered the YouTube channel "Cracking the Cryptic," but it took guidance from Bridget N and many failed attempts to develop the concept into a fully realized game.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Development was done in Bridget's "free time" over a couple of years. Many different clue types were trialed for Gruzzler, as finding a great self-setting clue proved to be challenging. Some of these alternative clue types may appear in future updates.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Bridget N, the founder and creative director for Gruzzler, is a graduate student with a special interest in grid logic. Her expertise and vision shaped Gruzzler into the unique puzzle experience it is today.

							<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Exploration-Based Deduction:</strong> Unlike traditional sudoku puzzles, Gruzzler encourages players to discover their own path through the puzzle.</li>
								<li><strong>Adaptive Difficulty:</strong> With 81 potential clues on a 9x9 grid, the game can be as challenging or as accessible as the player needs.</li>
								<li><strong>Puzzle Sharing:</strong> Players can share their unique sets of clues, effectively becoming puzzle creators for others to enjoy.</li>
								<li><strong>Directional Clue System:</strong> Arrows point to the closest matching number, creating an intuitive yet deep puzzle-solving experience.</li>
								<li><strong>Simple Pricing Model:</strong> Free with ads, or $1 a month to remove ads, with an optional tip system for supporting the developers.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2 id="future">Future Plans</h2>
							<p>
								The biggest evolution for Gruzzler in the future will be in more gameplay modes. We've already proven that you can use Gruzzler discovery with other clue types to do some interesting puzzle design. We'd also like to have some guest setters for Sundays or something like that, we really do respect hand-set puzzles.
							</p>
							
							<h2 id="audience">Target Audience</h2>
							<p>
								Gruzzler can be a fun/relaxing thing for hard-core enthusiasts or a stepping-stone for alternative logic for players that have only seen standard Sudoku.

								"My favorite approach is to really exploit strong placement in the beginning. My programmers play these wild completely random openings and go from there, I think it's a culture thing." - Bridget N

							<ul>
								<li>"The eureka moment was the first time we found a self-setting clue that was fun. It's hard to balance information gain and discovery to make 'fun'." - <cite>Bridget N, Founder</cite></li>
								<li>"Gruzzler is a little dry, but not as dry as traditional sudoku. We wanted to give players 50% of the discovery fun from a game like Wordle, 50% of the accomplishment feeling you get from traditional grid logic, and 50% of the cleverness I get from solving alternative Sudoku, which is 150% if things work out!" - <cite>Bridget N, Founder</cite></li>
								<li>"Playing Gruzzler has been the most rewarding part of making it, which is why I want to share it." - <cite>Bridget N, Founder</cite></li>
								<li>"Gruzzler represents a shift in my philosophy about puzzle games. When my programmer friend came to me with the idea, I thought it was really bad. I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but 'guessing' seemed like a terrible way to make a deduction game. I had a 'show me' attitude about it though, because he is smart, and enthusiastic. I just knew a lot more about logic games than he did. So, when he brought the first clue (that we're not using) and it worked, I was pretty excited. The idea of 'discovery' clicked with me and reframed my thinking." - <cite>Bridget N, Founder</cite></li>
