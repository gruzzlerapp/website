        <h1>Privacy Policy for Gruzzler</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 16, 2026</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Gruzzler LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Gruzzler mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and safeguarded when you use our App. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the App.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Our Commitment to Privacy:</strong> Gruzzler does not collect, store, or process any personal data from any user on its own servers. The only data collection that occurs in the App is through Google AdMob, our third-party advertising partner. You can enable <strong>Privacy Mode</strong> in the App to disable targeted ads entirely.
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Gruzzler itself does not collect any personal information or usage data. We do not operate our own analytics, tracking, or data collection systems.</p>
        <p>The only data collection in the App is performed by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, our third-party advertising provider, which is used to display ads within the App.</p>

        <h3>Information Collected by Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>When ads are displayed, Google AdMob may collect and process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising ID (IDFA on iOS, GAID on Android)</li>
            <li>IP address and coarse location data</li>
            <li>Device information (make, model, operating system, app version)</li>
            <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
            <li>Demographic information and interests for personalized advertising</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When <strong>Privacy Mode</strong> is enabled, targeted advertising is turned off and AdMob's data collection is significantly reduced. Non-personalized ads are shown based on contextual information rather than your personal data.</p>

        <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect data ourselves, information collected by Google AdMob is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display personalized or non-personalized advertisements based on your preferences</li>
            <li>Measure ad performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Privacy Mode</h2>
        <p>Gruzzler includes a <strong>Privacy Mode</strong> setting that you can enable at any time within the App. When Privacy Mode is turned on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Targeted (personalized) ads are disabled</li>
            <li>Only non-personalized, contextual ads are shown</li>
            <li>Google AdMob's collection of interest-based and demographic data is restricted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can toggle Privacy Mode on or off at any time in the App's Settings.</p>

        <h2>Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your activity. You may opt out of personalized advertising by enabling Privacy Mode in the App or by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We do not store any user data on our servers. Advertising data collected by Google AdMob is retained and managed by Google in accordance with their privacy policy.

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        
        <h3>In-App Controls</h3>

            <li>Withdraw consent for personalized advertising at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Device-Level Controls</h3>
        <p>You can also manage advertising preferences at the device level:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Data collected by Google AdMob may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. These countries may have data protection laws different from those in your country. By using the App, you consent to such transfers. For more details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
